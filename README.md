# DevSig
The goal of DevSig is to help engineers and their managers know whether theyâ€™re meeting standards for an engagement, and allow them to self-correct before a partner churns.

DevSig observes relevant habits as you interact with your machine. Some of these habits include: how often you type on Slack, how often you type on Jira, how often you have your cameras on when on a Zoom call, among others.
The purpose is to better understand engineers' habits with the end goal of being able to recommend habits or behaviors that increase chances for success.

To use DevSig, you install it globally on your machine, get it started, and proceed to use your machine as you'd normally use it. DevSig keeps running in the background, observing relevant habits, and keeping a log of its observations locally on your machine. **DevSig never sends any data to any party. All data is stored on your local machine.**

You can generate reports of these recorded observations in order to have an idea of your habit over time, and to provide evidence to your manager of the good work that you're doing.

**Again, this information is never shared or uploaded anywhere, it stays in a local log file on your computer. Nobody can view this information but you.**

## Getting Started
- Install globally `npm install --global devsig`
- Run `devsig start` to get the service up and running.
- Continue using your machine as usual while the service runs.
- Run `devsig report` to generate a report from all the data the service has gathered thus far.

## Getting Help
- Run `devsig --help` to see all available commands. The `--help` flag also gives you info about each command. For instance, to find out more about the `devsig start` command, run `devsig start --help`.
- If you encounter any runtime error (like `Cannot find module 'iohook'`), stop the service, run `devsig fix`, restart the service.
- You can always contact the LearnTech team for more assistance.

## How DevSig Works

## Monitors
A monitor is a service that runs in the background and constantly monitors a particular user or system behavior.

- To see all monitors, run `devsig list`
- To start all monitors, run `devsig start`
- To start a particular monitor, run `devsig start {monitor}`
    - For instance, to run the Slack monitor, run `devsig start slack`

Most monitors keep a log of the activities they monitor.

You can exclude monitors in your config.
